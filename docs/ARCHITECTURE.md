# RewardFlow Architecture Documentation

## Overview

RewardFlow is a comprehensive Uniswap V4 hook system that aggregates and distributes rewards to liquidity providers across multiple chains. The architecture is built on top of EigenLayer's AVS (Actively Validated Service) framework and integrates with Across Protocol for cross-chain distribution.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **RewardFlowHook** - Primary Uniswap V4 hook for tracking LP activity
2. **RewardFlowHookMEV** - MEV detection and capture hook
3. **CrossChainPositionTracker** - Multi-chain position management
4. **RewardDistributor** - Cross-chain reward distribution engine
5. **Supporting Libraries** - Activity tracking, tier calculations, and reward math

### Integration Points

- **Uniswap V4**: Native hook integration for activity tracking
- **EigenLayer**: AVS framework for decentralized reward aggregation
- **Across Protocol**: Cross-chain reward distribution infrastructure

## Data Flow

### 1. Activity Tracking
```
LP Activity → RewardFlowHook → ActivityRecording → CrossChainPositionTracker
```

### 2. Reward Calculation
```
Activity Data → TierCalculations → RewardMath → RewardDistributor
```

### 3. Cross-Chain Distribution
```
RewardDistributor → Across Protocol → Target Chain → User Wallet
```

## Security Model

### EigenLayer Integration
- Economic security through restaked ETH
- Slashing protection for malicious operators
- Decentralized validation of reward calculations

### Hook Security
- `onlyPoolManager` modifier for hook functions
- Input validation and bounds checking
- Arithmetic overflow/underflow protection

## Performance Considerations

### Gas Optimization
- Efficient storage patterns
- Minimal external calls
- Optimized reward calculations

### Scalability
- Batch processing for large reward distributions
- Efficient cross-chain communication
- Optimized data structures

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
