# RewardFlow Reward System Documentation

## Overview

The RewardFlow reward system is designed to incentivize liquidity providers across multiple chains through a sophisticated tier-based reward mechanism. The system tracks user activity, calculates personalized rewards, and distributes them efficiently across chains.

## Core Components

### 1. Activity Tracking

The system tracks various types of user activity:

- **Liquidity Provision**: Adding/removing liquidity from Uniswap V4 pools
- **Swap Volume**: Volume generated through user swaps (benefits LPs)
- **Position Duration**: Time-weighted liquidity provision
- **Cross-Chain Activity**: Activity across multiple supported chains

### 2. Tier System

RewardFlow implements a 5-tier reward system:

#### Diamond Tier (2.0x multiplier)
- **Requirements**: 1000+ ETH total liquidity, 90+ loyalty score
- **Benefits**: Maximum reward multiplier, priority distribution, exclusive features

#### Platinum Tier (1.5x multiplier)
- **Requirements**: 500+ ETH total liquidity, 70+ loyalty score
- **Benefits**: High reward multiplier, early access to features

#### Gold Tier (1.2x multiplier)
- **Requirements**: 100+ ETH total liquidity, 50+ loyalty score
- **Benefits**: Moderate reward boost, enhanced analytics

#### Silver Tier (1.1x multiplier)
- **Requirements**: 10+ ETH total liquidity, 30+ loyalty score
- **Benefits**: Small reward boost, basic analytics

#### Base Tier (1.0x multiplier)
- **Requirements**: Any liquidity provision
- **Benefits**: Standard rewards, basic tracking

### 3. Reward Calculation

Rewards are calculated using the following formula:

```
Final Reward = Base Reward × Tier Multiplier × Activity Score × Chain Multiplier
```

Where:
- **Base Reward**: Calculated from liquidity amount and duration
- **Tier Multiplier**: Based on user's current tier (1.0x - 2.0x)
- **Activity Score**: Based on consistency and engagement (0.5x - 1.5x)
- **Chain Multiplier**: Based on target chain and token pair (0.8x - 1.2x)

### 4. Cross-Chain Distribution

The system supports distribution across multiple chains:

- **Ethereum**: Primary chain for high-value rewards
- **Arbitrum**: Layer 2 for cost-effective distributions
- **Polygon**: Fast and cheap distributions
- **Base**: Coinbase's Layer 2 solution

## Reward Types

### 1. Liquidity Provision Rewards
- **Base Rate**: 0.1% of liquidity provided per day
- **Bonus**: Additional rewards for longer-term positions
- **Multiplier**: Applied based on user tier and activity

### 2. MEV Capture Rewards
- **Source**: MEV captured by RewardFlowHookMEV
- **Distribution**: Distributed proportionally to active LPs
- **Frequency**: Distributed weekly or when threshold is reached

### 3. Engagement Rewards
- **Consistency Bonus**: Rewards for regular activity
- **Cross-Chain Bonus**: Additional rewards for multi-chain participation
- **Referral Bonus**: Rewards for bringing new users

## Distribution Mechanism

### 1. Threshold-Based Distribution
- Users can set minimum reward thresholds
- Automatic distribution when threshold is reached
- Manual claiming available at any time

### 2. Cross-Chain Optimization
- Gas cost optimization across chains
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Smart routing through Across Protocol

### 3. User Preferences
- **Preferred Chain**: Where to receive rewards
- **Claim Threshold**: Minimum amount before auto-distribution
- **Claim Frequency**: How often to check for distributions
- **Auto-Claim**: Enable/disable automatic claiming

## Security and Validation

### 1. EigenLayer Integration
- Decentralized validation of reward calculations
- Economic security through restaked ETH
- Slashing protection for malicious operators

### 2. Smart Contract Security
- Input validation and bounds checking
- Arithmetic overflow/underflow protection
- Access control through modifiers

### 3. Audit and Testing
